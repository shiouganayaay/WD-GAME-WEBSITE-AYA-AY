            <p>Founded in 2006, Riot Games has grown from a small independent game studio to a global leader in game
              development, publishing, and esports. Our first title, League of Legends, was released in 2009 and has
              since become one of the most-played PC games in the world. We've since expanded our portfolio with games
              like VALORANT, Teamfight Tactics, and Legends of Runeterra.</p>
